//
// Program Name: C.A.I.T
// Description: The purpose of C.A.I.T is to introduce the concept of 'sentence transposition'
// Sentence transposition is basic way of conjugating verbs inside the 'user input' by changing them
// from the 'first person' to the 'second person' or the reverse.
// Ex: if the user enters: I THINK THAT YOU ARE INTELLIGENT, the Chatbot could reply:
// SO, YOU THINK THAT I'M INTELLIGENT.
// Notice: it's not a good thing to use 'sentence transposition' too much because it could quickly
// reveal the emchanism behind this feature or simply making the conversations appear less intelligent.
// In the current program, the 'sentence transposition' feature has been implemented using the
// 'transpose( std::string &str )' function and it is also supported by two other functions:
// 'find_subject()' and 'preprocess_response()'
//
